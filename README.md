# Karting Base App

This is another draft of my Karting data app idea but the main parts were built out using the Michael Hartl Rails course before I added the custom functionality.

Summary
- Code along self built Auth
- Code along tests (some custom parts added)
- Code along Micropost feature
- Code along relationship feature to allow following

Custom added entry model to explore basic idea of chassis setup data recording - (see other repo for a working version without Auth)

Began to add Chassis and Entry models to allow recording of chassis and engine details with the intention to give user ability to have a garage of equipment and at some point be able to mark as stolen, creating a register for equipment.

Added a Track model as intended to user the track model to further improve the Entry feature and use location weather data and automatically add to the entry record.

Unfinished as wanted to start again with Devise for Auth and Tailwind for styling
